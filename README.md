## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Setup)

To run the AI Interview Coach on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+**: [Download & Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Git**: [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **Google Gemini API Key**:
    1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    2.  Sign in with your Google account.
    3.  Click "Create API key in new project" (or select an existing project).
    4.  **Copy your generated API key immediately.**

### Installation & Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/007Harshvardhan/ai-interview-friend.git](https://github.com/007Harshvardhan/ai-interview-friend.git)
    cd ai-interview-friend
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you clone the correct repository where your project resides.)*

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    # macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Ensure gunicorn is also installed:
    pip install gunicorn
    ```
    *(If you just ran `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, `gunicorn` should already be in it. If not, run `pip install gunicorn` and then `pip freeze > requirements.txt` again.)*

4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    * In the root of your project directory, create a file named `.env`.
    * Add your Gemini API Key:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        **Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key.**

5.  **Verify `app.py` for Local Run:**
    * Open `app.py`.
    * Ensure the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block looks like this for local development:
        ```python
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            os.makedirs(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], exist_ok=True)
            app.run(debug=True) # Keep this line for local testing
        ```

6.  **Run the Flask Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will start, usually on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

7.  **Access in Browser:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üåê Deployment to Render.com

This project is configured for seamless deployment on [Render.com](https://render.com/).

### Deployment Preparation

1.  **Verify `requirements.txt`:** Ensure it includes `gunicorn` and all other project dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Create/Verify `Procfile`:** In your project root, create a file named `Procfile` (no extension) with this content:
    ```
    web: python -m gunicorn app:app
    ```

3.  **Modify `app.py` for Production:** Comment out `app.run(debug=True)`:
    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        os.makedirs(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], exist_ok=True)
        # app.run(debug=True) # Commented out for production deployment
    ```
    Ensure `load_dotenv()` is at the very top of `app.py` after imports.

4.  **Create/Update `.gitignore`:** Ensure it contains:
    ```
    .env
    venv/
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    uploads/
    ```

5.  **Commit and Push to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```
